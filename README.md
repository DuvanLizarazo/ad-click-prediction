# Project Summary

This project involves analyzing a dataset from an advertising campaign to predict whether internet users will click on an advertisement. The dataset includes various features such as daily time spent on the site, age, area income, daily internet usage, gender, and other demographic details.

We performed a detailed exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics of users and their likelihood of clicking on ads. Key insights revealed that age was the most significant predictor of ad clicks, with older users being more likely to engage. In contrast, features like daily time spent on the site and daily internet usage had a lesser impact, and gender and area income had minimal influence.

Using logistic regression, we trained a model to predict ad clicks based on these features. The model showed good performance with an accuracy of 91%, and the evaluation metrics highlighted that age had the strongest influence on the likelihood of clicking an ad. Other features like daily time spent on site and daily internet usage were less impactful.

This analysis provides valuable insights into user behavior and helps in targeting ads more effectively. Understanding the key factors driving ad clicks can guide marketing strategies and improve customer engagement. This project lays the groundwork for further refinement and optimization of advertising campaigns.
